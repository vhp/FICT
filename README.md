FICT is a simple file integrity checking tool.

Basic usage is as follows.
```
cd ~
fict init
fict add ~/Documents
fict list
fict compute
fict check
```

The database will is stored in `~/.fict`. The fict_db file that's normally in `~/.fict`
can be manipulated manually. The changes will be ingested upon next run.

The location of where the `fict_db` can be stored can be specified with the option
`--fict-dir`.

If you don't specify a location the present working directory will be chosen.
